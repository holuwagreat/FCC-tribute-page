          <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Albert Einstein life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1879</strong> - Born in  Ulm, Germany</li>
            <li>
              <strong>1900</strong> -attended the Federal Polytechnic in Zurich, 
              going on to do his PhD at the University of Zurich.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1905</strong> In this year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), 
              Einstein published four groundbreaking papers.These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect,
               explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1914</strong> -Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and 
              the Humboldt University of Berlin.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1902</strong> - Marić and Einstein were collaborators and lovers and had a daughter Lieserl in 1902, 
              whose fate is unknown. They later had two sons, Hans Albert and Eduard. 
              They separated in 1914, with Marić taking the boys and returning to Zürich from Berlin. 
              They divorced in 1919; that year Einstein married again.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1933</strong> - while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. 
              Einstein, of Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government;
               he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1921</strong>
              The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921 was awarded to Albert Einstein "for his services to Theoretical Physics, 
              and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1948</strong> - Einstein essentially rejected being the president of Israel 
              because he didn't think he was a great people person,and he didn't have the experience required for the job.
              Imagine if all politicians thought like that — wouldn't the world be a better place?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1921</strong> -He is also known for his discovery of the photoelectric effect,
               for which he won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1900</strong> - Einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. 
              It was published in 1901 with the title "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen", 
              which translates as "Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena". 
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1962</strong> -In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, 
              nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person:
               "He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness 
              ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>1955</strong> -17 April, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, 
              which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948.He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance
               commemorating the state of Israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital,but he did not live to complete it.
